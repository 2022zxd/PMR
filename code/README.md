Our code is modified based on previous work. For other related operations, you can also directly refer to [this link](https://github.com/aduquet/RENE-PredictingMetamorphicRelations/tree/main).

Run singleMR.py to obtain the evaluation results of each MRs. 

Run overall.py to obtain the overall evaluation results.

you can run like is:

	python singleMR.py -i "/home/zxd/Desktop/PMR/data/vector/python/UniXcoder-python.csv" -ns 10 

The classifier that runs by default is SVM and the language is python. When you want to run other operations(classifier or language java/C++), you need to make corresponding modifications to the code content.
